<center><h1>INFO</h1></center>
<h4>Information about the additional library, external Api used in this project and general information</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>wikipedia Api</strong> <p>Used when user add movie and 
when he didn't writen description, application found itself appropriate  description using wikipedia Api, if title will be wrong and application couldn't did this, in label 'description' will be put information from label 'tiltle'</p></li>
<li><strong>GeoIP2</strong><p>
Used when user add cinema and didn't writen 'city', in this case application check your public ip (you can check your public ip yourself in website <a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/">https://www.whatismyip.com/</a>) and with using api GeoIP2 found city where user is, and put name of city in label 'city'
</p></li>
<li><strong>django-crontab</strong>
<p>using for delete screening when screening is out-of date.
Every 5 seconds crontab check screening datetime, and when actual date and time is more than date and time in screening it will be delete</p>
<p>don't forget write this command 
<code>python manage.py crontab add</code>
</p></li>
<li><strong>Views</strong>
<p>I write it with using API views, it's my own personal choice because I think in this case you can better see what is going on underneath 
(in further I will use generic views and mixing because it's less writing code  &#128527;)</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Tests</strong>
<p>i used pytest-django to testing my application</p>
<p> run test using command <code>pytests</code></p></li>

<h3 id="clone_project">Clone and Run a Django Project</h3>

Before diving let‚Äôs look at the things we are required to install in our system.

To run Django prefer to use the Virtual Environment

`pip install virtualenv`

Making and Activating the Virtual Environment:-

`virtualenv ‚Äúname as you like‚Äù`

`source env/bin/activate`

Installing Django:-

`pip install django`

Now, we need to clone project from Github:-
<p>Above the list of files, click Code.</p>
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-20363/images/help/repository/code-button.png">

Copy the URL for the repository.
<ul>
<li>To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", click</li>
<li>To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click SSH, then click</li>
<li>To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click GitHub CLI, then click</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-33207/images/help/repository/https-url-clone-cli.png">

Open Terminal.

Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

`$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`

Press Enter to create your local clone.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...<br>
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

Install the project dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now go to the setting.py and change the SECRET_KEY.
from
`SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`
to
`SECRET_KEY = 'your own secret key'`
and `DEBUG = True`

create admin account (**remember you must be at the main application folder with file manage.py, and do this steps for
each application in this repository!!!!**)

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

then

`python manage.py makemigrations`

then again run

`python manage.py migrate`

run this command to start periodic tasks in application

`python manage.py crontab add`

run this code to add in database actors movies and directors and bee in one wave with me

`python manage.py addactorsdirectorsfilms`

to start the development server

`python manage.py runserver`

and open localhost:8000 on your browser to view the app.

Have fun
